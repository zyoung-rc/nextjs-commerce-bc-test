## Prerequisites

Next.js + BigCommerce requires a [BigCommerce sandbox](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/partner/create-a-sandbox) or a [production store provisioned to run a headless storefront](https://www.bigcommerce.com/solutions/multi-store/). Consult the following articles in BigCommerce's DevDocs for configuration and guidance:

- [Next.js + BigCommerce Configuration](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/storefronts/nextjs-commerce)
- [Guide to Building Headless Storefronts](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/storefronts/guide/overview)

## Develop locally

To automatically clone the template repo and configure Vercel environment variables for your project, use the [Deploy with Vercel](#) button at the beginning of this README. After you complete the interactive configuration sequence, you can clone the automatically-created project to your local environment.

You can also clone the template repo manually and supply the environment variables [defined in .env.example](.env.example). The best practice is to use [Vercel environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: Do not commit your `.env` file. It exposes secrets that allow others to control your BigCommerce store.

1. Install the Vercel CLI:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

2. Link your local instance with the desired Vercel and GitHub accounts. This action creates a `.vercel` directory:

```bash
vercel link
```

3. Download the [Vercel environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables):

```bash
vercel env pull
```

4. Install the app's default dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The app runs on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## Configure checkout

- [Optimized One-Page Checkout](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/customizing-checkout/optimized-one-page-checkout)
- [Stencil theme to customize checkout page](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/getting-started/about-stencil#stencil-cli) and inform styling of shopper emails

## Get to know the BigCommerce GraphQL Storefront API

In addition to being compatible with BigCommerce's multi-storefront features, Next.js + BigCommerce uses the [GraphQL Storefront API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/storefront/graphql/graphql-api-overview). This API makes it possible for merchants to control the representation of products and categories, carts, orders, customer segmentation, and more. To get a sense of what is possible to do directly on the storefront, check out the [GraphQL Playground](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/graphql-storefront/playground).

When you access the Playground through the store control panel, BigCommerce provides a valid GraphQL Storefront authentication token without any additional API calls on your part. To access the dedicated GraphQL Playground for a particular sandbox or store, sign in to its BigCommerce account and navigate to **[Settings > API](https://login.bigcommerce.com/deep-links/manage/settings-list)**, then click **Storefront API Playground**.
